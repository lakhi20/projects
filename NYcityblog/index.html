<main><section class="blog"> <article><p>New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and
     Staten Island. The city is the home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the City of New 
     York what is known as the Statue of Liberty, which is currently located on Ellis Island commonly visited by 
     tourists. However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore wasn’t unveiled until 1886. Another tourist 
     destination is Times Square. Times Square is commonly known for the big buildings, Broadway shows, and bright 
     neon signs. This famous location was named after The New York Times after the Times moved to that location. Prior 
     to that, it was named Longacre Square. New York City is also known for its bridges that connect the boroughs and allow ease of transportation.
